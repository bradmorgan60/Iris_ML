"# Iris_ML" 
This is my first time experimenting with Machine Learning from tne Iris dataset built in to the sci-learn library for Python. I have used this dataset before when dipping my toes in R, but really want to learn this in Python too. 

I am very excited to show you my results and findings. This is an ongoing project and I will continue to add to this README.md file with dates.

The YouTube channel, DataProfessor inspired me to tackle this dataset on my own. I love watching his videos and continuing my learning journey in Data Science!
